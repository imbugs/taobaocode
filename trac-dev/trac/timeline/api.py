        Each filter must be a (name, label) tuple, where `name` is the internal
        name, and `label` is a human-readable name for display.

        Optionally, the tuple can contain a third element, `checked`.
        If `checked` is omitted or True, the filter is active by default,
        otherwise it will be inactive.

    def get_timeline_events(req, start, stop, filters):
        """Return a list of events in the time range given by the `start` and

        The `filters` parameters is a list of the enabled filters, each item
        being the name of the tuples returned by `get_timeline_filters`.

        Since 0.11, the events are `(kind, date, author, data)` tuples,
        where `kind` is a string used for categorizing the event, `date`
        is a `datetime` object, `author` is a string and `data` is some
        private data that the component will reuse when rendering the event.

        When the event has been created indirectly by another module,
        like this happens when calling `AttachmentModule.get_timeline_events()`
        the tuple can also specify explicitly the provider by returning tuples
        of the following form: `(kind, date, author, data, provider)`.

        Before version 0.11,  the events returned by this function used to
        be tuples of the form `(kind, href, title, date, author, markup)`.
        This is still supported but less flexible, as `href`, `title` and
        `markup` are not context dependent.

                      be rendered: can be the 'title', the 'description' or
