"""functional_tests

While unittests work well for testing facets of an implementation, they fail to
provide assurances that the user-visible functions work in practice.  Here, we
complement the unittests with functional tests that drive the system as a user
would to verify user visible functionality.  These functional tests are run as
part of the unittests.

So, we use Twill to verify Trac's functionality as served by tracd (and in the
future, other frontends).

Unlike most unittests, we setup a single fixture against which we run all the
testcases.  This is for two reasons: Primarily, that provides us with a more
complex set of data to test against and thus more room for triggering bugs.
Secondarily, the cost of setting up a new Trac environment and Subversion
repository is significant, so recreating the fixture for each test would be
very costly.

There are two primary objects involved in the testing, the
FunctionalTestEnvironment and the FunctionalTester.

FunctionalTestEnvironment represents the Trac environment, the Subversion
repository, and the server.  The server will be run on a random local port in
the range 8000-8999.  A subdirectory named 'tracenv' will be created containing
the Trac environment, Subversion repository, and the user authentication
information.  An 'admin' user is created and given TRAC_ADMIN privs early in
the testing.  There are other users added as well.  All accounts are setup with
a password equalling the username.  The test environment is left behind after
the testing has completed to assist in debugging.

FunctionalTester provides code reuse for the testcases to allow a higher-level
description of the more complicated bugs.  For example, creating a new ticket
is the first step in regression testing many things, so FunctionalTester
provides a create_ticket() method.  That method is written as if it were itself
a testcase for creating a ticket, so there is a testcase that simply calls that
method, and other testcases that use it as a higher-level step don't have to
worry about basic issues such as if the ticket was successfully created.

Requirements:
 - Twill (http://twill.idyll.org/)
 - subprocess (py2.4)
 - lxml for XHTML validation (optional)
