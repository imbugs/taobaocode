                 or `None` if indifferent. If `None` is returned, the next
                 policy in the chain will be used, and so on.

        Note that when checking a permission on a realm resource (i.e. when
        `.id` is `None`), this usually corresponds to some preliminary check
        done before making a fine-grained check on some resource.
        Therefore the `IPermissionPolicy` should be conservative and return:

         * `True` if the action *can* be allowed for some resources in
           that realm. Later, for specific resource, the policy will be able
           to return `True` (allow), `False` (deny) or `None` (don't decide).
         * `None` if the action *can not* be performed for *some* resources.
           This corresponds to situation where the policy is only interested
           in returning `False` or `None` on specific resources.
         * `False` if the action *can not* be performed for *any* resource in
           that realm (that's a very strong decision as that will usually
           prevent any fine-grained check to even happen).

        Note that performing permission checks on realm resources may seem
        redundant for now as the action name itself contains the realm, but
        this will probably change in the future (e.g. `'VIEW' in ...`).
