Trac is distributed with a powerful command-line configuration tool. This tool can be used  to configure and customize your Trac-installation to better fit your needs.

Some of those operations can also be performed via the ''Admin'' web interface, an updated version of the [http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/WebAdmin WebAdmin] plugin now integrated within Trac (since version 0.11).

== Usage ==

You can get a comprehensive list of the available options, commands and sub-commands by invoking `trac-admin` with the `help` command:.
{{{
trac-admin help
}}}

Unless you're executing the `help`, `about` or `version` sub-commands, you'll need to specify the path to the TracEnvironment that you want to administer as the first argument, for example:
{{{
trac-admin /path/to/projenv wiki list
}}}

== Interactive Mode ==

When passing the environment path as the only argument, `trac-admin` starts in interactive mode.
Commands can then be executed on the selected environment using the prompt, which offers tab-completion
(on non-Windows environments, and when the Python `readline` module is available) and automatic repetition of the last command issued.

Once you're in interactive mode, you can also get help on specific commands or subsets of commands:

For example, to get an explanation of the `resync` command, run:
{{{
> help resync
}}}

To get help on all the Wiki-related commands, run:
{{{
> help wiki
}}}

=== Notes ===

The `initenv` also supports an extra `--inherit` option, which can be used to specify the `[inherit] file` option at environment creation time so that only the options ''not'' already specified in the global configuration file will be written in the conf/trac.ini file of the newly created environment.
See TracIni#GlobalConfiguration.

Note that in version 0.11 of Trac, `initenv` lost an extra last argument `<templatepath>`, which was used in previous versions to point to the `templates` folder. If you are using the one-liner '`trac-admin /path/to/trac/ initenv <projectname> <db> <repostype> <repospath>`' in the above and getting an error that reads ''''`Wrong number of arguments to initenv: 4`'''', then this is because you're using a `trac-admin` script from an '''older''' version of Trac.
