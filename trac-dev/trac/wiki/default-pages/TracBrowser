= The Trac Repository Browser =
[[TracGuideToc]]

The Trac repository browser can be used to browse specific revisions of directories 
and files stored in the repository of the configured version control system.

Directory entries are displayed in a list with sortable columns. The list 
entries can be sorted by ''name'', ''size'' or ''age'' by clicking on the column
headers. The sort order can be reversed by clicking on a given column
header again.

The browser can be used to navigate through the directory structure 
by clicking on the directory names. Clicking on a file name will show
the contents of the file. Clicking on the revision number of a file or
directory will take you to the TracRevisionLog for that file.
Note that there's also a ''Revision Log'' navigation link that will do
the same for the path currently being examined.

It's also possible to browse directories or files as they were in history,
at any given repository revision. The default behavior is to display the
latest revision but another revision number can easily be selected using
the ''View revision'' input field at the top of the page.

''(since 0.11)'':

The color bar next to the Age column gives a visual indication of the age
of the last change to a file or directory. In the default configuration,
blue is older and red is newer, but this can be [TracIni#browser-section configured].

At the top of the browser page, there's a drop-down menu which you can use 
to select some interesting places in the repository, for example branches or tags. 
This is sometimes referred to as the ''browser quickjump'' facility.
The precise meaning and content of this menu depends on your backend.
For Subversion, this list contains by default the top-level trunk directory and sub-directories of the top-level branches and tags directories (`/trunk`, `/branches/*`, and `/tags/*`).  This can be [TracIni#svn-section configured] for more advanced cases.

If you're using a Javascript enabled browser, you'll be able to expand and collapse folders in-place by clicking on the arrow head at the right side of a folder. Alternatively, the [trac:TracKeys keyboard] can also be used for this: use 'j' and 'k' to go to the next or previous entry, and 'o' (or 'Enter') to toggle between expanded and collapsed state of the selected folder or for visiting the selected file.

For the Subversion backend, some additional features are available:
 - Displays the `svn:needs-lock` property
 - Support for the `svn:externals` property (which can be [TracIni#svn:externals-section configured])
 - The `svn:mime-type` property is used to select the syntax highlighter for rendering the file. For example, setting `svn:mime-type` to `text/html` will ensure the file is highlighted as HTML, regardless of the file extension. It also allows selecting the character encoding used in the file content. For example, if the file content is encoded in UTF-8, set `svn:mime-type` to `text/html;charset=utf-8`. The `charset=` specification overrides the default encoding defined in the `default_charset` option of the `[trac]` section of [TracIni#trac-section trac.ini].
