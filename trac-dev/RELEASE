Release Notes for Trac 0.11.7 Genshi Release
============================================
March 10, 2010

Trac 0.11.7 contains a handful of bug fixes,
performance improvements and minor enhancements.

Changes in 0.11.7
-----------------

Security fixes:
 - Fixed a ticket validation issue that would allow unauthorized users to modify the status and resolution of a ticket (#8884)

Performance improvements:
 - Trac wiki had some trouble handling very long unicode words (#9025) [[comment(intentionally kept vague, we don't want to advertize a DOS, do we?)]]
 - Full text search was very slow if lots of custom fields were used (#8935)

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed a race condition that could lead to the destruction of the trac.ini file (#8623)
 - Fixed creation of new milestone which could have been a rename if performed after a name clash has been detected (#8816)
 - Fixed display of value 0 in report cells (#7512)


Highlights in 0.11
------------------
 * New template engine for generating content (Genshi)
 * New configurable workflow in the ticket subsystem
 * Finer-grained control of permissions
 * Support for Pygments as the default syntax highlighter
 * Improved repository browser ("blame" support, dynamic in-place
   expansion of folders)
 * Improved user preferences subsystem, among which the possibility for
 * any user to select their time zone and disable access keys
 * The WebAdmin plugin is now an integral part of Trac
 * Paging of timeline and query results.

Detailed User Visible Changes
=============================

User Preferences
----------------
A new user preference module has been added. It presents by default
several panels and plugins can easily add their own user settings there:

 * General (name and e-mail information)
 * Date & Time (timezone)
 * Keyboard Shortcuts (enable/disable)
 * Pygments Theme
 * Advanced (restore session)

Most significantly, support for setting the time zone has been added to
the Date & Time panel.

Each user can select which time zone they want timestamps to be presented
in. If pytz is installed a complete list of time zones will be available,
otherwise Trac will fall back on a shorter list from an internal time
zone implementation.

Wiki
----
 * Usability improvements:
 
   - possibility to review changes before saving a new version of a page
   - basic handling of conflicts in case of concurrent edits
   - Restored direct link to History and revert to an Index link, from
     where it's easy to switch between the Index by Title and Index by
     Date
   - The [[PageOutline]] macro now works as expected in preview mode

 * Wiki syntax improvements:
 
   - most TracLinks now accept trailing arguments (?...) and targets
     (#...)
   - more intuitive relative links ([.. parent page], [./OtherPage
     sibling page], [/WikiStart toplevel page])
   - relative links like [#anchor see this section] always link to the
     proper originating page or ticket, irrelevant from where the wiki
     text appears (e.g. in the timeline)
   - new #!div wiki processor and new [[span]] macro added. The former
     can be used to encapsulate an arbitrary block of wiki markup in a
     <div> element. The second can be used to encapsulate an arbitrary
     fragment of wiki markup in a <span> element. Both div and span
     can be provided with attributes like class=... or style="...".
   - [[Image]] macro can now "link" to an arbitrary TracLinks instead
     of the image's attachment itself
   - InterTrac prefixes written alone can be used to target the
     default page in the remote Trac, e.g. [TracHacks: the site for
     contributing Trac plugins]
   - trac: InterTrac prefix is known by default and refers to the
     "Trac for Trac"

Ticket System
-------------

Ticket Editing

 * The ticket workflow is now configurable, see TracWorkflow
 * Improved preview, showing the comment preview at the top of the page,
   so one can see at the same time the preview of the comment and the
   preview of the fields and the description in the ticket box
 * It is now possible to examine the changes made to the ticket
   description and textual custom fields
 * The display of field changes has been improved and is now more
   compact
 * Major usability enhancement for the CC: field
 * Like for the concurrent wiki edits, a conflict due to simultaneous
   editing of a ticket by two or more users lead to warnings, minimizing
   the risk for the user to lose his changes
 * Syntax for linking to arbitrary ticket comments is now more
   intuitive: use comment:3:ticket:123 for linking to the 3^rd comment
   of ticket #123. Alternatively, you can write: ticket:123#comment:3
   (but not #123#comment:3!)

Roadmap and Milestone

 * The Milestones can now have attachments
 * If needed, it is possible to configure additional ticket groups to be
   shown in the milestone progress bar (according to the status). For
   even more complex needs, a plugin can now take over the way the
   tickets and stats are collected.

Reports and Custom Queries

 * Improved custom queries:
 
   - columns can now be selected
   - possibility to save custom queries as reports
   - possibility to configure the default custom query, both for
   - anonymous and authenticated users
 * the [[TicketQuery]] now supports a format=table option, which will
   produce the usual tabular result of a custom query, see the macro
   documentation.
 * the custom query can list a fixed set of tickets, either using the
   [[TicketQuery]] macro or query: links

Repository Browser
------------------
 * "Blame" support (annotation of every line with the changeset which
   last modified them)
 * Dynamically expandable folders for Javascript enabled browsers
 * "Quickjump" navigation menu for easily going to branches and tags
 * Alternative text view on diffs for Javascript enabled browsers
 * Significantly improved patch renderer (supports extended diff
   formats)
 * Support for svn:externals and other properties. Improved display of
   property changes. In addition, support for custom properties can be
   added through plugins.
 * Add the ability to highlight arbitrary ranges of lines in the source
   code, using the appropriate source TracLinks
 * Add the ability to access to the raw content of files inside the
   repository using export TracLinks.
 * Revision log display is more compact and allows selecting a diff for
   the whole range of specified revisions
 * Changeset display of list of files is more compact as well and shows
   the main location where the changes happened. That can also be done
   in the timeline by setting the [timeline] changeset_show_files
   configuration entry to location instead of a number.

General
-------
Setuptools is now used for the packaging

This means you'll be able to just do

easy_install Trac

once we've made the release.

It also means that a number of things had to be changed to make this work
correctly. In particular, Trac no longer implicitly assumes nor installs
global data in the $prefix/share/trac. Instead, you'll have to modify the
configuration of your project environments to explicitly “inherit” a
global configuration in trac.ini, for example:

[inherit]
file = /etc/trac/trac.ini

This will load the configuration from the /etc/trac/trac.ini file, while
of course allowing to override any global settings in the environment's
configuration.

In that global configuration, you can specify shared directories for
templates and plugins, e.g.:

[inherit]
plugins_dir = /etc/trac/plugins/
templates_dir = /etc/trac/templates/

  Note: naming of these options may still change until the final 0.11
        release

Improved Syntax Highlighting

Trac can now use the Pygments syntax highlighter out-of-the-box. This is
a much nicer syntax highlighter than the one previously supported (
SilverCity, Enscript and PHP).

Lots of other minor improvements

 * all configuration changes made to the TracIni files are now taken
   into account immediately, without the need for a server restart
 * e-mail obfuscation everywhere turned on by default (can be disabled
   project wide or on a per-user basis
 * possibility to configure the navigation bars (see TracNavigation)
 * Timeline improvements:
 
   - paging support
   - remember user settings
   - more configuration settings for tweaking the display of the
     events (see TracIni#timeline-section)
 * Search improvements:
   - OpenSearch support

Caveats
-------
 * It is strongly advised to set the [trac] base_url setting for
   generating correct URLs outside the context of a user request.
   However, contrary to what happened for a while in 0.10.5dev, this
   setting won't be used for the redirects, unless Trac is explicitly
   told to do so, with the use_base_url_for_redirect setting.
 * The [trac] templates_dir setting is considered harmful... You
   probably need to remove that setting when you browse Trac and get the
   following plain text error:

   TemplateNotFound: Template "error.html" not found

   FIXME: is this still the case?
 * The support for MySQL as a database backend has not improved
   significantly in any ways... It is still considered to be
   experimental for 0.11. YMMV.
 * The usual trick of wrapping a piece of wiki text inside a <div> for
   advanced custom formatting can't be done anymore using the #!html
   WikiProcessor, as that one can only produce well-formed HTML
   fragments. Instead, one must use the new #!div Wiki processor for
   that.

Wiki Macros

The change in templating engines necessitated a change in wiki macros.
The HelloWorld and Timestamp macros which are distributed with trac will
not work as released.

For examples of new style macros, see some of the macros which have
already been ported at MacroBazaar or ports of HelloWorld and Timestamp
attached to #5274.

Developer-visible changes
=========================
Many changes happened under the hood, among them:

 * Trac now uses the Genshi template engine instead of ClearSilver.
   Plugins using the latter will still be supported in Trac 0.11, but
   probably not longer.
 * Trac used to handle time informations as int timestamps. Now we're
   using datetime objects.

A detailed view of the API changes since 0.10.x can be found in TracDev/
ApiChanges/0.11.

Acknowledgements
----------------
Many thanks to the growing number of people who have, and continue to,
support the project. Also our thanks to all people providing feedback and
bug reports that helps us making Trac better, easier to use and more
effective.

Without your invaluable help, Trac would not evolve. Thank you all.

Finally, we offer hope that Trac will prove itself useful to like-minded
programmers around the world, and that this release will prove an
improvement over the last version.

Please let us know. :-)
